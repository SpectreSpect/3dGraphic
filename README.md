# 3dGraphic
In this project I tried to create 3d graphic using winAPI without any graphical libraries such as directX, vulcan and so on. The syntax in this program is similar to the syntax in dirextX 11.

For some reasons the project works only with x64 Debug:

And, at the end, it require to put dll file in the same folder where are .exe file (it is descripted in the site I put before)
